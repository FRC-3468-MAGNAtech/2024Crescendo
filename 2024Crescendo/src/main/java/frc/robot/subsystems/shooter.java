public class shooter {
    //The shooter needs to run the motors at a certain speed when called upon
    // It will need to shoot at two different speeds.  1 is slower for scoring in the amp, one is faster for scoring in the speaker
    // it will have two brushless NEO motors.  
    // it will have two SPARKMax controllers
    // It has two belts.  
// data types
    //integer - negative and positive whole numbers
    //double - decimal

    //boolean - 

    //Things I have to know
    // gear ratio
    // diameter of the wheels that shoot the note

    //methods

    // ShootSpeaker (High speed shot)
//1. recieve input from button push
//2. turn on motor
    //i. use shootSpeaker to set speed
    //ii. turn on motor
//3. allow to run for specific amount of time
    //i. add interrupt for external controller override
//4. turn off 

    // OoozeAmp (Low speed shot)
    //1. recieve input from button push
//2. turn on motor
    //i. use ShootAmpSpeed to set speed
    //ii. turn on motor
//3. allow to run for specific amount of time
    //i. add interrupt for external controller override
//4. turn off
